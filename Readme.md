About
--------------
This was a project for an interview I did and part of the project was to have the code available on github. If this is usefull to you then awesome, if you use it and find a bug submit a pull request and even better. 
This app will download and parse the logs from Rapid7's Internet-Wide Scan Data Repository and input them into Elastic Search or MySQL. 

The web interface will provide a search and api function. 

...More Coming very soon.
